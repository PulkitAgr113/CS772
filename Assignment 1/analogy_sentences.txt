Historically, the heritage of the French people is mostly of Celtic or Gallic, Latin (Romans) origin, descending from the ancient and medieval populations of Gauls or Celts from the Atlantic to the Rhone Alps, Germanic tribes that settled France from east of the Rhine and Belgium after the fall of the Roman Empire such as the Franks, Burgundians, Allemanni, Visigoths, and Suebi, Latin and Roman tribes such as Ligurians and Gallo-Romans, Basques, and Norse populations largely settling in Normandy at the beginning of the th century as well as "Bretons" (Celtic Britons) settling in Brittany in Western France
The French people, especially the native speakers of langues d'ol from northern and central France, are primarily the descendants of Gauls (including the Belgae) and Romans (or Gallo-Romans, western European Celtic and Italic peoples), as well as Germanic peoples such as the Franks, the Visigoths, the Suebi and the Burgundians who settled in Gaul from east of the Rhine after the fall of the Roman Empire, as well as various later waves of lower-level irregular migration that have continued to the present day
In addition to mainland France, French people and people of French descent can be found internationally, in overseas departments and territories of France such as the French West Indies (French Caribbean), and in foreign countries with significant French-speaking population groups or not, such as the United States (French Americans), Canada (French Canadians), Argentina (French Argentines), Brazil (French Brazilians), Mexico (French Mexicans), Chile (French Chileans) and Uruguay (French Uruguayans)
 From the middle of the th century, it experienced a high rate of inward migration, mainly consisting of  Spaniards, Portuguese, Italians, Arab-Berbers, Jews, Sub-Saharan Africans, Chinese, and other peoples from Africa, the Middle East and East Asia, and the government, defining France as an inclusive nation with universal values, advocated assimilation through which immigrants were expected to adhere to French values and cultural norms

 According to its principles, France has devoted itself to the destiny of a proposition nation, a generic territory where people are bounded only by the French language and the assumed willingness to live together, as defined by Ernest Renan's "plbiscite de tous les jours" ('everyday plebiscite') on the willingness to live together, in Renan's  essay "Qu'est-ce qu'une nation
In the s, during the Second Mexican Empire ruled by Emperor Maximilian I of Mexicoin collaboration with Mexican conservatives and part of Napoleon III's plan to create a Latin empire in the New World (indeed responsible for coining the term of "Amrique latine", "Latin America" in English)-- many French soldiers, merchants, and families set foot upon Mexican soil
Hobsbawm highlighted the role of conscription, invented by Napoleon, and of the s public instruction laws, which allowed mixing of the various groups of France into a nationalist mold which created the French citizen and his consciousness of membership to a common nation, while the various regional languages of France were progressively eradicated
 This conception of the nation as being composed by a "will to live together," supported by the classic lecture of Ernest Renan in , has been opposed by the French far-right, in particular the nationalist Front National ("National Front"  FN  now Rassemblement National - "National Rally" - RN) party which claims that there is such a thing as a "French ethnic group"
 However, despite its occasional nativist usage, the Gaulish identity has also been embraced by French of non-native origins as well notably, Napoleon III, whose family was ultimately of Corsican and Italian roots, identified France with Gaul and Vercingetorix, and declared that "New France, ancient France, Gaul are one and the same moral person
 Myriam Krepps of the University of Nebraska-Omaha argues that the view of "a unified territory (one land since the beginning of civilization) and a unified people" which de-emphasized "all disparities and the succession of waves of invaders" was first imprinted on the masses by the unified history curriculum of French textbooks in the late s
The  Franco-Prussian War, which led to the short-lived Paris Commune of , was instrumental in bolstering patriotic feelings until World War I (), French politicians never completely lost sight of the disputed Alsace-Lorraine region which played a major role in the definition of the French nation and therefore of the French people
 While Ernest Renan's arguments were also concerned by the debate about the disputed Alsace-Lorraine region, he said that not only one referendum had to be made in order to ask the opinions of the Alsatian people, but also a "daily referendum" should be made concerning all those citizens wanting to live in the French nation-state
According to historian Eric Hobsbawm, "the French language has been essential to the concept of 'France'," although in ,  percent of the French people did not speak it at all, and only  to  percent spoke it fairly well even in ol languages zones, it was not usually used except in cities, and even there not always in the outlying districts

 These people include the Swedish-speakers in mainland Finland  speaking a Swedish dialect commonly referred to as Finland Swedish (finlandssvenska which is part of the East-Swedish dialect group) and the almost exclusively Swedish-speaking population of land speaking in a manner closer to the adjacent dialects in Sweden than to adjacent dialects of Finland Swedish
Toward the end of the war, Sweden began to play a role in humanitarian efforts and many refugees, among them many Jews from Nazi-occupied Europe, were saved partly because of the Swedish involvement in rescue missions at the internment camps and partly because Sweden served as a haven for refugees, primarily from the Nordic countries and the Baltic states
 Because the Swedish peasantry had never been enserfed as elsewhere in Europe, the Swedish farming culture began to take on a critical role in the Swedish political process, which has continued through modern times with modern Agrarian party (now called the Centre Party)
 Sweden also has a long history of participating in international military operations, including most recently, Afghanistan, where Swedish troops are under NATO command, and in EU sponsored peacekeeping operations in Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Cyprus
 The Swedish-speaking people living in near-coastal areas on the north-eastern and eastern side of the Baltic Sea also have a long history of continuous settlement, which in some of these areas possibly started about a millennium agocitation needed

The native language of nearly all Swedes is Swedish (svenska svnska (listen)) a North Germanic language, spoken by approximately  million people, predominantly in Sweden and parts of Finland, especially along its coast and on the land islands
 It also claims that a mix of these ideas is found in more mundane uses of the word Swedish, in media and ordinary speech and that it should be understood in the light of how national stories of Sweden have been formed over a long period of time

 Among the traditions enlisted to this end were federal sharpshooting competitions or tirs,  because they were one of the few recognized symbols of pan-Swiss identity prior to the creation of the  Confederation and because they traditionally involved men from all levels of society, including the peasants, who in Romantic nationalism had become ideologically synonymous with liberty and nationhood
Although the  modern state of Switzerland  originated in , the period of romantic nationalism, it is not a nation-state, and the Swiss are not a single ethnic group, but rather are a confederacy (Eidgenossenschaft) or Willensnation ("nation of will", "nation by choice", that is, a consociational state), a term coined in conscious contrast to "nation" in the conventionally linguistic or ethnic sense of the term
Consequently, the Swiss elites during the period of the formation of nation states throughout Europe did not attempt to impose a national language or a nationalism based on ethnicity, instead  pushing for the creation of a civic nation grounded in democratic ideology, common political institutions, and shared political ritual
Identification with the national symbolism relating to the Old Swiss Confederacy was especially difficult for the cantons which had been joined to the Helvetic Republic in  without any prior membership in the Swiss Confederacy, and which were given the status of Swiss cantons only after the end of the Napoleonic era
These requirements were significantly reduced in a  revision of the law,  allowing naturalization after a minimal period of residence of ten years, and in certain cases as little as five years (naturalization of spouses and children of Swiss citizens years of residence at ages  to  count double)
 As Swiss citizenship is tied to the cantonal citizenship associated with the "place of origin" (Heimatort or Brgerort "home commune, commune of citizenship"),  a citizen's place of origin is inherited from his or her father (from the mother if born out of wedlock or if the father holds no citizenship)
Modern Switzerland is atypical in its successful political integration of a multiethnic and multilingual populace, and is often cited as a model for new efforts at creating unification, as in the European Union's frequent invocation of the Swiss Confederate model
 The Swiss Romandie was formed by the accession of French-speaking Geneva and Neuchtel and the partly francophone Valais and Bernese Jura (formerly part of the Prince-Bishopric of Basel) to the Restored Swiss Confederacy in 
The demonym Swiss (formerly in English also called Switzer) and the name of Switzerland, ultimately derive from the toponym Schwyz, have been in widespread use to refer to the Old Swiss Confederacy since the th century
The Swiss Constitution of  regulated certain rights that the cantons were required to grant to citizens of other cantons, such as the right of residence (in the case of naturalized citizens after a period of five years)
 For example, the "Swiss illness", the condition of Swiss mercenaries pining for their mountainous native home, became prototypical of the medical condition of nostalgia ("homesickness") described in the th century
Article  still defines Swiss citizenship as inherited from communal and cantonal citizenship "Any person who is a citizen of a commune and of the Canton to which that commune belongs is a Swiss citizen
In the preamble to the current Swiss Constitution of , a "Swiss People" (Schweizervolk) is invoked alongsides "the Cantons" as sovereign entity, and article  reads "The People and the Cantons 
A similar view is attributed to Gottfried Keller, who is cited to the effect that the Swiss Confederacy could not exist without the endemic rivalry between cantons
The Swiss people (German die Schweizer, French les Suisses, Italian gli Svizzeri, Romansh ils Svizzers) are the citizens of Switzerlandb or people of Swiss ancestry
Switzerland experienced significant immigration from Italy in the very late th and early th century, such that in  that accounted for some  of the Swiss population
 Their cultural history is dominated by the Alps, and the alpine environment is often cited as an important factor in the formation of the Swiss national character
From the th century there were conscious attempts to foster a federal "Pan-Swiss" national identity that would replace or alleviate the cantonal patriotisms
Swiss citizenship is still primarily citizenship in one of the Swiss cantons, and the naturalization of foreign citizens is the privilege of the cantons
defined Swiss citizenship as inherited from cantonal citizenship  Jeder Kantonsbrger ist Schweizer Brger ("every citizen of a canton is a Swiss citizen")

While the relationship of reales   (or peso duro) continued in the Americas until the th century, Spain grappled with the issuance of reales de vellon (made of billon alloy with less than  silver) of various weights and finenesses starting in  due to its domestic financial and monetary problems
The Philippine peso (Filipino piso) is derived from the Spanish silver coin Real de a Ocho or Spanish dollar, in wide circulation in the entire America and Southeast Asia during the th and th centuries, through its use in the Spanish colonies and even in the United States and Canada
 Faced with this threat to her silver exports, Mexico returned to the old eight-real peso by decree of May , , but international trade was already shifting from silver to gold, and after  there was a steady decline in the international price of silver
Initially the peso was produced in Spanish Latin America in a rapid and simplified manner by cutting off a lump of silver of proper weight and fineness from the end of a silver bar, which was then flattened out and impressed by a hammer
 The coin was sometimes called a Republican dollar, but eventually any peso of the old Spanish eight-real standard was generally referred to as a Mexican dollar, Mexico being the most prolific producer
 This new peso became even more popular in international trade, with recipients finding it more advantageous to trade it as coined silver of known value rather than melting it into silver bullion
Prior to  the Philippines had no currency of its own (with the exception of local copper cuartos) since pesos received from Spain and Spanish Latin America were accepted in circulation

 Jnos Karcsonyi assumed that central and northern Slovakia were uninhabited () and in his next work "Our historical right to the territorial integrity of our country" () he claimed that the remainder of the original Slavs were assimilated by Magyars and modern Slovaks are descendants of immigrants from Upper Moravia and Oder (the population density on these territories was too low in that time and large numbers of colonists coming from these areas was not possible)
After the Ottoman Empire was forced to retreat from present-day Hungary around , thousands of Slovaks were gradually settled in depopulated parts of the restored Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Hungary, Romania, Serbia, and Croatia) under Maria Theresia, and that is how present-day Slovak enclaves (like Slovaks in Vojvodina, Slovaks in Hungary) in these countries arose
After Transylvania, Upper Hungary (present-day Slovakia) was the most advanced part of the Kingdom of Hungary for centuries, but in the th century, when BudaPest became the new capital of the kingdom, the importance of the territory, as well as other parts within the Kingdom fell, and many Slovaks were impoverished
 However, the Slovak national revival not only accepted the continuity of population but also emphasized it, thus proving that Slovaks are equal citizens of the state and neither a Hungarian "unique statesmanlike gift" nor Christianization was required for the foundation of the state
 Hunfalvy tried to prove that ancestors of Slovaks did not live in the territory of the present-day Slovakia before arrival of the old Hungarians (Magyars), but Slovaks emerged later from other Slavs who came to the Kingdom of Hungary from neighbouring countries after the th century
 While dialects of the early ancestors of Slovaks were divided into West Slavic (western and eastern Slovakia) and non-West Slavic (central Slovakia), between the th and th centuries both dialects merged, thus laying the foundations of a later Slovak language

 In fact, there is a continuous range of "in-between" spoken varieties from nearly pure Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), to a form that still uses MSA grammar and vocabulary but with significant colloquial influence, to a form of the colloquial language that imports a number of words and grammatical constructions in MSA, to a form that is close to pure colloquial but with the "rough edges" (the most noticeably "vulgar" or non-Classical aspects) smoothed out, to pure colloquial
 Arabic is also an important source of vocabulary for languages such as Amharic, Azerbaijani, Baluchi, Bengali, Berber, Bosnian, Chaldean, Chechen, Chittagonian, Croatian, Dagestani, Dhivehi, English, German, Gujarati, Hausa, Hindi, Kazakh, Kurdish, Kutchi, Kyrgyz, Malay (Malaysian and Indonesian), Pashto, Persian, Punjabi, Rohingya, Romance languages (French, Catalan, Italian, Portuguese, Sicilian, Spanish, etc
In late pre-Islamic times, a transdialectal and transcommunal variety of Arabic emerged in the Hejaz, which continued living its parallel life after literary Arabic had been institutionally standardized in the nd and rd century of the Hijra, most strongly in Judeo-Christian texts, keeping alive ancient features eliminated from the "learned" tradition (Classical Arabic)
 In many spoken varieties, the backed or "emphatic" vowel allophones spread a fair distance in both directions from the triggering consonant in some varieties (most notably Egyptian Arabic), the "emphatic" allophones spread throughout the entire word, usually including prefixes and suffixes, even at a distance of several syllables from the triggering consonant
 The phonological differences between these two dialects account for some of the complexities of Arabic writing, most notably the writing of the glottal stop or hamzah (which was preserved in the eastern dialects but lost in western speech) and the use of alif maqrah (representing a sound preserved in the western dialects but merged with  in eastern speech)
 In addition, many cultural, religious and political terms have entered Arabic from Iranian languages, notably Middle Persian, Parthian, and (Classical) Persian, and Hellenistic Greek (kmiy has as origin the Greek khymia, meaning in that language the melting of metals see Roger Dachez, Histoire de la Mdecine de l'Antiquit au XXe sicle, Tallandier, , p
 Superheavy syllables in Classical Arabic occur in only two places at the end of the sentence (due to pausal pronunciation) and in words such as  rr 'hot',  mddah 'stuff, substance',  tajj 'they disputed with each other', where a long  occurs before two identical consonants (a former short vowel between the consonants has been lost)
 Its emphatic counterpart  was considered by Arabs to be the most unusual sound in Arabic (Hence the Classical Arabic's appellation   lughat al-d or "language of the d") for most modern dialects, it has become an emphatic stop d with loss of the laterality or with complete loss of any pharyngealization or velarization, d
 Also, while it is comprehensible to people from the Maghreb, a linguistically innovative variety such as Moroccan Arabic is essentially incomprehensible to Arabs from the Mashriq, much as French is incomprehensible to Spanish or Italian speakers but relatively easily learned by them
 These academies and organizations have worked toward the Arabization of the sciences, creating terms in Arabic to describe new concepts, toward the standardization of these new terms throughout the Arabic-speaking world, and toward the development of Arabic as a world language
There are several features which Classical Arabic, the modern Arabic varieties, as well as the Safaitic and Hismaic inscriptions share which are unattested in any other Central Semitic language variety, including the Dadanitic and Taymanitic languages of the northern Hejaz
 They are conjugated in two major paradigms (past and non-past) two voices (active and passive) and six moods (indicative, imperative, subjunctive, jussive, shorter energetic and longer energetic), the fifth and sixth moods, the energetics, exist only in Classical Arabic but not in MSA
Nouns in Literary Arabic have three grammatical cases (nominative, accusative, and genitive also used when the noun is governed by a preposition) three numbers (singular, dual and plural) two genders (masculine and feminine) and three "states" (indefinite, definite, and construct)
 In response, a number of Arabic academies modeled after the Acadmie franaise were established with the aim of developing standardized additions to the Arabic lexicon to suit these transformations, first in Damascus (), then in Cairo (), Baghdad (), Rabat (), Amman (), Khartumar (), and Tunis ()
With the sole example of Medieval linguist Abu Hayyan al-Gharnati  who, while a scholar of the Arabic language, was not ethnically Arab  Medieval scholars of the Arabic language made no efforts at studying comparative linguistics, considering all other languages inferior
In modern times the intrinsically calligraphic nature of the written Arabic form is haunted by the thought that a typographic approach to the language, necessary for digitized unification, will not always accurately maintain meanings conveyed through calligraphy
 An original p lenited to f, and   consistently attested in pre-Islamic Greek transcription of Arabic languages  became palatalized to  or  by the time of the Quran and d, ,  or  after early Muslim conquests and in MSA (see Arabic phonologyLocal variations for more detail)
Arabic has consonants traditionally termed "emphatic" t, d, s,  (, , , ), which exhibit simultaneous pharyngealization t, d, s,  as well as varying degrees of velarization t, d, s,  (depending on the region), so they may be written with the "Velarized or pharyngealized" diacritic ( ) as t, d, s, 
 While there is a minimum level of comprehension between all Arabic dialects, this level can increase or decrease based on geographic proximity for example, Levantine and Gulf speakers understand each other much better than they do speakers from the Maghreb
"In the wake of the industrial revolution and European hegemony and colonialism, pioneering Arabic presses, such as the Amiri Press established by Muhammad Ali (), dramatically changed the diffusion and consumption of Arabic literature and publications
 The development of low-cost housing was a priority for Chandigarh, and the modern forms designed by Corbusier are characterised by a dispensing with colonial forms focused on classic aesthetics and a refocusing on strategies such as using narrow frontages and orientation for minimising direct exposure to the sun and maximising natural ventilation and efficient cost while providing modern amenities in the International Style aesthetic
 Chandigarh was for Nehru and Le Corbusier an embodiment of the egalitarian potential offered by modernism, where the machine age would complete the liberation of the nation's citizens through the productive capacity of industrial technology and the relative ease of constructing civic facilities such as dams, hospitals, and schools the very antithesis of the conservative and traditional legacy of colonialism
 As well as in Chandigarh this policy tool was implemented in the creation of new capital cities in Bhubaneswar and Gandhinagar, and more broadly throughout India in the  planned cities created between independence and , purposed to absorb migration from those regions in demise after being abandoned by the British and provide hubs for growing industries such as in steel and energy
 Claims have been made that the focus on Corbusier's architect-centred discourse erases the plural authorship of the narrative of Chandigarh's development, arguing that it was, in fact, hybridity of values and of "contested modernities" of Western and indigenous Indian origin and cultural exchanges rather than an uncontested administrative enterprise
 Furthermore, the early over-saturation of the minimalist International Style in building design in Chandigarh has attracted criticisms of effecting a "democratic, self-effacing banality", though this criticism is perhaps negligent of how this was necessary for galvanising higher standards of urban living throughout the country

 For Nehru, Chandigarh represented a vision of how a new planned city could be a canvas for the regeneration of the nation itself after centuries of oppression under British colonial rule and the dilution of Indian character from the nation's towns
 Guided by the architectural optics of Le Corbusier, the development of Chandigarh was part of a state-driven exercise to break from the traditions of imperialism in city making and begin the process of healing from the injustices suffered
 With an estimated cost of around billion including  funds from the governments of Punjab and Haryana and  from Chandigarh and government of India, funds from the Japanese government were proposed to include approximately  of the cost

 This was followed by a nationalist backlash during the late th and early th centuries that saw little help from the Dutch government (which for a long time following the Belgian Revolution had a reticent and contentious relationship with the newly formed Belgium and a largely indifferent attitude towards its Dutch-speaking inhabitants) and, hence, focused on pitting "Flemish" culture against French culture, resulting in the forming of the Flemish nation within Belgium, a consciousness of which can be very marked among some Dutch-speaking Belgians
 This wide array of regional identities positioned within such a relatively small area, has often been attributed to the fact that many of the current Dutch provinces were de facto independent states for much of their history, as well as the importance of local Dutch dialects (which often largely correspond with the provinces themselves) to the people who speak them

In , in order to ease pressure on exporters, the central bank introduced a currency certificate system allowing exporters to trade certificates for hard currency on the Tehran Stock Exchange, thus creating a floating value for the rial known as the "TSE rate" or "market rate"
 At times (before the devaluation of the rial in ) the authorities weakened the national currency intentionally by withholding the supply of hard currency to earn more rial-denominated income, usually at times when the government faced a budget deficit
The unofficial rial to US dollar rate underwent severe fluctuations in January  (the rial losing  of its value in a few days, following new international sanctions against the CBI), eventually settling at Rls, at the end of the period
 Priorities  and  are food and medicine, receiving foreign exchange at the official rate of Rls, per dollar, followed by other categories with lower priorities, which are mostly intermediate goods used in industrial production

 According to the Wall Street Journal and dealers, the Iranian government was selling USmillion daily to keep the rial exchange rate against the US dollar between Rls, and Rls, in 
The value of Rial has dropped by  since the nationwide protests that began on september , following the death of Mahsa Amini, a  year old Kurdish-Iranian woman in police custody

citation needed John Lie, Eiji Oguma, and other scholars problematize the widespread belief that Japan is ethnically homogeneous, arguing that it is more accurate to describe Japan as a multiethnic society, although such claims have long been rejected by conservative elements of Japanese society such as former Japanese Prime Minister Tar As, who once described Japan as being a nation of "one race, one civilization, one language and one culture"
Following the opening of Japan to the West in , some works of this style were written in English by natives of Japan they include Bushido The Soul of Japan by Nitobe Inaz (), concerning samurai ethics, and The Book of Tea by Okakura Kakuz (), which deals with the philosophical implications of the Japanese tea ceremony

Depending on the context, the term ethnic Japanese (, Nihon minzoku) may be limited or not to mainland Japanese people, specifically the Yamato (as opposed to Ryukyuan and Ainu people)
After World War II, Kotondo Hasebe and Hisashi Suzuki claimed that the origin of Japanese people was not newcomers in the Yayoi period ( BCE   CE) but the people in the Jmon period
 Currently, the most well-regarded theory is that present-day Japanese people formed from both the Yayoi rice-agriculturalists and the various Jmon period ethnicities

 After the cessation of official relations with the Tang dynasty in the ninth century, Japanese art and architecture gradually became less influenced by China

 The Zirids also fought against other Zenata Kingdoms, for example the Maghrawa, a Berber dynasty originating from Algeria and which at one point was a dominant power in the Maghreb ruling over much of Morocco and western Algeria including Fez, Sijilmasa, Aghmat, Oujda, most of the Sous and Draa and reaching as far as M'sila and the Zab in Algeria

 The indigenous cultural and religious resistance heavily opposed this tendency, but in contrast to the other colonized countries' path in central Asia and Caucasus, Algeria kept its individual skills and a relatively human-capital intensive agriculture
 Many cities in the northern parts of the Algerian desert paid taxes to Algiers or one of its Beys, although they otherwise retained complete autonomy from central control, while the deeper parts of the Sahara were completely independent from Algiers
 Much of the eastern territories of Algeria were under the authority of the Hafsid dynasty, although the Emirate of Bejaia encompassing the Algerian territories of the Hafsids would occasionally be independent from central Tunisian control

Due to close proximity to the Arabian Sea, Gujarat has developed a mercantile ethos which maintained a cultural tradition of seafaring, long-distance trade, and overseas contacts with the outside world since ancient times, and the diffusion of culture through Gujarati diaspora was a logical outcome of such a tradition
 From  to , most of present-day Gujarat, including Kathiawar, Kutch and northern and eastern Gujarat were divided into hundreds of princely states, but several districts in central and southern Gujarat, namely Ahmedabad, Broach (Bharuch), Kaira (Kheda), Panchmahal and Surat, were governed directly by British officials
Gujarat borders the Tharparkar, Badin and Thatta districts of Pakistan's Sindh province to the northwest, is bounded by the Arabian Sea to the southwest, the state of Rajasthan to the northeast, Madhya Pradesh to the east, and by Maharashtra, the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu to the south

 The Bank of Japan's policy of zero interest rates has discouraged yen investments, with the carry trade of investors borrowing yen and investing in better-paying currencies (thus further pushing down the yen) estimated to be as large as  trillion
Coins in denominations of less than  yen became invalid on December , , following enforcement of the Small Currency Disposition and Fractional Rounding in Payments Act (, Shgaku tska no seiri oyobi shiharaikin no haskeisan ni kan suru hritsu)
The spelling and pronunciation "yen" is standard in English because when Japan was first encountered by Europeans around the th century, Japanese e () and we () both had been pronounced je and Portuguese missionaries had spelled them "ye"
The yen replaced the complex monetary system of the Edo period in the form of Tokugawa coinage as well as the various hansatsu paper currencies issued by Japan's feudal fiefs in an array of incompatible denominations
The observe side of all coins shows the coin's value in kanji as well as the country name (through , Dai Nippon (, "Great Japan") after , Nippon-koku (, "State of Japan") (except for the current -yen coin with the country name on the reverse)
In the s, Japanese government and business people were very concerned that a rise in the value of the yen would hurt export growth by making Japanese products less competitive and would damage the industrial base
 The number of purchases is so large that it is expected to double the money supply, but this move has sparked concerns that the authorities in Japan are deliberately devaluing the yen to boost exports
 kuma proposed that coins, which were previously square, be made into circles, and that the names of the traditional currencies, ry (), bu () and shu (), be unified into yen (), which was accepted by the government
 The demand for the yen is governed by the desire of foreigners to buy goods and services in Japan and by their interest in investing in Japan (buying yen-denominated real and financial assets)
 This has not happened to date, since the yen remains trusted globally despite its low unit value, and due to the huge costs of reissuing new currency and updating currency-reading hardware
 Because of its high face value, the  yen coin has been a favorite target for counterfeiters, resulting in the issuance in  of the second nickel-brass  yen coin with added security features
 The Act also stipulated the adoption of the decimal accounting system of yen (, ), sen (, ), and rin (, ), with the coins being round and manufactured using Western machinery acquired from Hong Kong
Following the silver devaluation of , the yen devalued against the US and Canadian dollars (since those two countries adhered to a gold standard), and by , the yen was worth only about US
Despite intervention, market pressures caused the yen to continue climbing in value, peaking temporarily at an average of  per US in , before the impact of the  oil crisis was felt
 occupation government fixed the value of the yen at  per US through a United States plan, which was part of the Bretton Woods system, to stabilize prices in the Japanese economy
 This capital flow increased the supply of yen in foreign-exchange markets, as Japanese investors changed their yen for other currencies (mainly dollars) to invest overseas
 Low interest rates combined with a ready liquidity for the yen prompted investors to borrow money in Japan and invest it in other countries (a practice known as carry trade)
 That was the first full-scale Japanese-EnglishEnglish-Japanese dictionary, which had a strong influence on Westerners in Japan and probably prompted the spelling "yen"
 The rise in the current account surplus generated stronger demand for yen in foreign-exchange markets, but this trade-related demand for yen was offset by other factors
 The government, therefore, continued to intervene heavily in foreign-exchange marketing (buying or selling dollars), even after the  decision to allow the yen to float

 Even though Mexico's government has downplayed the racial connotations of said studies by opting for using the term "light-skinned Mexican" to refer to the segment of Mexico's population who possess European physical traitsappearance and "dark-skinned Mexican" to refer the segment of Mexico's population who does not, the publication of said studies hasn't been free of controversy, specially in the case of the study published in  as besides skin color it also accounted for different socioeconomic factors such as educational achievements and occupational profiles, with media outlets bringing to Mexico's mainstream opinion circles concepts such as systemic racism, white privilege, and colonialism
A similar situation occurs regarding the distinctions between Indigenous peoples and Mestizos while the term Mestizo is sometimes used in English with the meaning of a person with mixed indigenous and European blood, this usage does not conform to the Mexican social reality where a person of pure Indigenous genetic heritage would be considered Mestizo either by rejecting his indigenous culture or by not speaking an indigenous language, and a person with none or a very low percentage of indigenous genetic heritage would be considered fully indigenous either by speaking an indigenous language or by identifying with a particular indigenous cultural heritage
Nationwide surveys sponsored by the Mexican government that quantify the percentage of the different skin tones present on Mexico's population have been made, the first in  by the CONAPRED (Mexico's National Bureau for Prevention of Discrimination) and the second in  by the INEGI (Mexico's National Institute of Statistics) Each study used a different color palette, in the case of CONAPRED's study it was a palette with  color choices developed by the institute itself whereas in the case of the INEGI study the palette used was the palette for the PERLA (Latin American Race and Ethnicity Project) with  color categories
The Mestizaje ideology, which has blurred the lines of race at an institutional level has also had a significative influence in genetic studies done in Mexico As the criterion used in studies to determine if a Mexican is Mestizo or indigenous often lies in cultural traits such as the language spoken instead of racial self-identification or a phenotype-based selection there are studies on which populations who are considered to be Indigenous per virtue of the language spoken show a higher degree of European genetic admixture than the one populations considered to be Mestizo report in other studies
Those DNA studies on Mexicans show a significant genetic variation depending on the region analyzed, with the central region of Mexico showing a balance between indigenous and European components, and the latter gradually increasing as one travels northwards and westwards, where European ancestry becomes the majority of the genetic contribution up until cities located at the MexicoUnited States border, where studies suggest there is a significant resurgence of indigenous and also African admixture
 Another study made by the University College London in collaboration with Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History found that the frequencies of blond hair and light eyes in Mexicans are of  and  respectively, surveys that use as reference skin color such as those made by Mexico's National Council to Prevent Discrimination and Mexico's National Institute of Statistics and Geography reported a percentages of  in  and  in  respectively
Cultural policies in early post-revolutionary Mexico were paternalistic towards the indigenous people, with efforts designed to "help" indigenous peoples achieve the same level of progress as the rest of society, eventually assimilating indigenous peoples completely to Mestizo Mexican culture, working toward the goal of eventually solving the "Amerindian problem" by transforming indigenous communities into Mestizo communities
 as White were then essential to cement the "mestizaje" ideology (that asserts that the Mexican population as a whole is product of the admixture of all races) which shaped Mexican identity and culture through the th century and remain prominent nowadays, with extraofficial international publications such as The World Factbook and Encyclopdia Britannica using them as a reference to estimate Mexico's racial composition up to this day
When the  census' results are compared with the results of Mexico's recent censuses as well as with modern genetic research, high consistence is found in regards to the distribution of Indigenous Mexicans across the country, with states located in south and south-eastern Mexico having both, the highest percentages of population that self-identifies as Indigenous and the highest percentages of Amerindian genetic ancestry
The following tables (the first from a study published in  and the second from a study published in ) show the frequencies of different blood types in various Mexican cities and states, as Mexico's AmerindianIndigenous population exclusively exhibits the "O" blood type, the presence of other blood groups can give an approximate idea of the amount of foreign influence there is in each state that has been analyzed
Extant research suggests that geographic location plays a more significative role on determining the genetic makeup of the average Indigenous person than cultural traits do, an example of this is the indigenous population of Tlapa in the state of Guerrero that despite for the most part speaking Spanish and having the same cultural customs non-indigenous Mexicans have, shows an indigenous ancestry of 
 Those studies have recently gained the attention of Mexico's government which has begun conducting its own nationwide investigations, with the aim of document dynamics and inequalities on interactions between Mexicans of different ethnicitiesraces as well as to have a more concise idea of the ethnic composition of the country (a field that has been long neglected at an institutional level in Mexico)
 The reason for the huge difference regarding the reported percentages of Mexicans with light skin (around  lower) and medium skin (around  higher) in the relation to previous nationwide surveys lies in the fact that the ENADIS  prioritized the surveying of Mexicans from "vulnerable groups" which among other measures meant that states with known high numbers of people from said groups surveyed more people
Ethnic relations in modern Mexico have grown out of the historical context of the arrival of Europeans, the subsequent Spanish period of cultural and genetic miscegenation within the frame work of the castas system, the revolutionary periods focus on incorporating all ethnic and racial group into a common Mexican national identity and the indigenous revival of the late th century
As the progression from the darker tones to the lightest ones is not as uniform in the palette used by the INEGI (some tones are practically the same while there are marked differences between others) as it is in the CONAPRED's palette, two color categories ended up containing nearly  of surveyed Mexicans whereas there were color categories that had less than  of Mexicans each
 However this is not the case when it comes to European Mexicans, as there are instances on which states that have been shown to have a considerably high European ancestry per scientific research are reported to have very small white populations in the  census, with the most extreme case being that of the state of Durango, where the aforementioned census asserts that only 
 Per the methodology of the study, the presence of blond hair was required for a Mexican to be classified as white as "unlike skin color, blond hair does not darken with sun exposure" With a similar methodology, other study, made by the Metropolitan Autonomous University of Mexico calculated the frequency of blond hair at , Mexicans with red red-hair were classified as "other"
 Mexican directors Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu (Amores perros, Babel, Birdman), Alfonso Cuarn (Children of Men, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Gravity, Roma), Guillermo del Toro (Pacific Rim, Crimson Peak, The Shape of Water), Carlos Carrera (The Crime of Father Amaro), and screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga are some of the most known present-day film makers
Some studies, such as the one published by the American Sociological Association refute misconceptions that are very prevalent even among Mexicans themselves, as it found the differences in the frequencies of phenotypical traits such as blond hair between the population of the Northern regions of Mexico (where this trait has a frequency of 
 The recognition of indigenous languages and the protection of indigenous cultures is granted not only to the ethnic groups indigenous to modern-day Mexican territory, but also to other North American indigenous groups that migrated to Mexico from the United States in the th century and those who immigrated from Guatemala in the s
